#[View Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/reportEmbed?reportId=e5262ec9-ee14-4e77-aeb4-207d67cae8c6&autoAuth=true&ctid=6232b055-76b9-4c13-9b88-b562ae7db6fb)

## 1. About the project: Visualizing the number of different types of threatened species and the potential causes
###### a. Some highlighted features that I will use when I work with SQL: 
- SELECT, SELECT DITINCT, SELECT TOP, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY
- AGGREGATION FUNCTION: MIN(), MAX(), SUM(), ROUND(), COUNT()
- CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO, **WITH AS**, **UNION**, **ISNULL**, UPDATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, CAST()

###### b. Some highlighted features that I will use when I work with PowerBI: 
- Multiple lines chart, Treemap, Card, Stacked bar chart
- Dynamic text utilizing Smart Narrative, Slicer

## 2. About the dataset: 
- There are two databaes in my project: 

###### a. Threatened Species: 
- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vineethakkinapalli/united-nations-environment-data?select=Water+and+Sanitation+Services.csv)
- Overall: The database contains the number of threatened species from 3 different types in different countries over the world.  
- Tool: SQL to clean and analyze, PowerBI to visualize

###### b. Threats to Wildlife: 
- Source: [Our world in data](https://ourworldindata.org/threats-to-wildlife#:~:text=80%25%20of%20threatened%20species%20are,aquaculture%20%E2%80%93%20is%20another%20leading%20threat.)
- Overall: This database contains information about many species are affected from different factors 
- Tool: PowerBI to visualize
